## Overview

Bangladesh, among the most densely populated countries globally, faces a critical issue with the structural safety of buildings in its capital city, Dhaka. Shockingly, approximately 90% of the buildings in Dhaka are deemed highly risky and susceptible to collapse during natural disasters like earthquakes. To address this pressing concern, our team aims to develop a solution utilizing deep learning technology to identify risky buildings within Dhaka city using satellite imagery.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to leverage the power of the YOLO object detection model to analyze satellite images of Dhaka. By employing deep learning techniques, we aim to pinpoint and classify buildings that are at high risk of collapse during natural hazards. The ultimate objective is to provide valuable insights to local authorities, enabling them to identify high-risk areas promptly and take necessary measures to ensure public safety.

## Current Update

ðŸš§ **Project Update**: We are currently in the process of updating our project to integrate the latest version of the YOLO model for real-time applications. This enhancement aims to increase detection accuracy and improve the speed of processing satellite imagery, allowing us to provide more immediate assessments and insights.

## Methodology

- **Utilization of YOLO model for object detection and classification**
- **Collection and preprocessing of satellite images of Dhaka city**
- **Training the model to recognize and categorize risky buildings**
- **Validation and testing of the model's accuracy and reliability**
- **Generating actionable insights and risk assessment reports based on the model's predictions**

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of our model. Contributions can include:

- Refining the training dataset
- Improving the model architecture
- Suggesting innovative approaches

Your contributions are valuable in our quest to make Dhaka city safer. Please feel free to reach out, open issues, or submit pull requests to support this initiative.

## Future Scope

- *Integration of real-time satellite data for continuous monitoring*
- *Collaboration with local authorities for effective implementation*
- *Expansion to other cities or regions facing similar structural safety challenges*
- *Enhancing model robustness for varied environmental conditions*
